# AllesNL PoC

## Mobile App
For the frontend PoC we want to develop a simple mobile app which shows how third party services can be used inside AllesNL.
We would like it to be usable on both Android and iOS.
The mobile app should have some connection to third party services, by using the API or an embedded web app.
For payment linkage the app could connect to the AllesNL backend to enable iDEAl payment.
